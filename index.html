        <h2>What are we doing?</h2>
        <p>Years of research in complex systems and iterative thinking by members of what became RatPark, culminated with the establishment of <a href="https://our-movement.org/" target="_blank">Our Movement</a> — a movement promoting radical social change by catalyzing the emergence of resilient societies. Dedicated to reclaiming, enriching, and expanding the commons — this movement focuses on producing a wide variety of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html" target="_blank">Free/Libre and Open Source Software</a> (FLOSS)<label for="floss" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input id="floss" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox"><span class="sidenote">free as in <i>speech</i> and <i>beer</i></span> that benefits the whole of humanity and the substrate we depend upon.</p>

        <h2>Why do it this way?</h2>
        <p>We want to approach problem-solving and collaboration by living and working communally, creating an environment to maximize happiness, health, purpose, and inspired work. Living in community makes us embody the shift from a highly individualistic culture to a highly cooperative one, along with providing many other advantages:</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Health</b>: Living as a community, as opposed to atomized lifestyles, is key to mental and emotional wellness, while a natural, off-grid setting with clean air, water, and organic food from our garden offers the ingredients for top physical health. There are also plenty of opportunities for gardening, hiking, working out, yoga, dancing, etc. to ensure an active lifestyle, with the option to push brain rpms with neurohacking tools (nootropic compounds, meditation, floating, etc.).</li>
            <li><b>Growth & Creativity</b>: Without the need to maintain a regular job, individuals can focus on producing their very best, purposeful work. Moreover, living among mature, sovereign individuals accelerates personal growth and makes our work more creative and resilient. Finally, direct contact with nature inspires biomimical thinking patterns — exactly the patterns we need to follow for a far more resilient world.</li>
            <li><b>Efficiency</b>: Communal living cuts out time and resource expenses significantly. Working in the same space as our collaborators, as atoms and cells as opposed to bits and pixels, spares the inefficiencies of coordinating through different areas and time zones. Activities such as cleaning and cooking are greatly reduced by performing them collectively. Tools, technologies, instruments, books, etc. are shared. </li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Status</h2>
        <p>The first park is currently under construction in a 14ha off-grid property, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica">Costa Rican</a> rainforest. The main space consists of a 300sqm common building — containing a reception area, industrial-size kitchen, dining area, a work space, and a mezzanine. Two dorms and five private rooms in the sleeping quarters can house up to 40 people and a 80sqm movement space will be available for yoga, meditation, workouts, etc.</p>
        <p>As we grow, we intend to open additional parks, where each one of them will host anywhere between 50 and 150 individuals, depending on property size and community dynamics.</p>
